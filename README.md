ðŸŽ® Cards-against-imaginary
 â€” A Multiplayer Word Game
 
Cards-against-imaginary is a lighthearted multiplayer web game built with Django. 
Players join a private game room via a unique link. 
Each round, one player (the curator) writes a sentence with a blank, and the others submit funny or clever words to complete it. 
The curator then picks their favorite submissionâ€”without knowing who wrote it. First player to reach 13 points wins!
